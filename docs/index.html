		Revenue is generated from:

		All revenues from the DAIX Transactions are sent to the "King-Maker" smart contract.

		All revenues from the trades on the Main-Pair are used to increase the Total Value Locked in Daibase Protocol.
		<li>From issuing Sovereign Debt</li>
		Sovereign Debt gets created when expansion of Supply takes place without adding to Total Value Locked (T.V.L.) or Protocol Controlled Value (P.C.V.). This primarily consists of Cardinal Price (Price at the Cardinal Pair) goes above 1 DAI and the Daibase Protocol enters anew Epoch.<br><i>(There is no debt creation within the same epoch and this incentivizes participants to rebalance the Cardinal Price back to 1 DAIX = 1 DAI This can also be viewed as a penalty to P&D traders ensuring stability.)</i>

		<li>DAIX are suited for debt-denoted forward\future contracts.</li>
		<li>Daibase can be used as a stable unit of account, much like a simple currency such as Bitcoin or Digital CHF, directly inside Smart Contracts.</li>

	Use the parti() function to participate in self-issuing DAIX tokens. The default function receive() can be used to send native coins to the DAIX smart contract and self-issue DAIX to the sender as well.
	<br><ul>NOTES:
	<li>No tax is levied on such transactions by the Daibase Protocol from the sender.</li>
	<li>Such transactions do however charge the tax from the Main-Pair's Liquidity Pool and send it to the King-Maker contract.</li>
	<li>These transactions would thus increase the price of DAIX tokens by a small amount, equal to square root of twice the issued amount's share in Liquidity Pool.</li>
	<li>Each such call to <b>parti</b> shall return and emit a few important things back in the calldata.</li>

	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<h4>ALWAYS "MINT" DAIX. NEVER "BUY" DAIX.</h4>
	If you "buy", you are certain to lose DAIX. Always use the "mint" function to acquire DAIX or get some from our shopping section.<hr style="padding:0;width:50%"><br><br>
	<div align="left">
		<details><summary><b>What is DAIX?</b></summary>
		DAIX is an elastic supply "rebasing" algorithmic stablecoin ‚Äïit adjusts to market conditions and maintains it's price at $1 by changing its circulating supply dynamically whenever someone presses the "BaseCannon" button on our Dapp.
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is DAOX?</b></summary>
		DAOX is the governance token of Daibase Protocol. Holders of DAOX get to decide the future of Daibase via creating and voting on "proposals". DAOX can always be earned through one of our farms, partner programs or other ecosytem incentives.
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>How to<i>"mint"</i>DAIX?</b></summary>
		There are 2 ways to mint DAIX tokens:<ol>
		<li>Visit the shopping section and enter the amounts you wish to buy.</li>
		<li>Send some XDAI directly to the Daibase Contract address.</li></ol>
		Please note that:<ul></li>
		<li>Use "Gas Limit" of 500000 (500k) when minting DAIX.</li>
		<li>"Minting" doesn't have any fees.</li>
		<li>"Minting" helps us increase the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV, a.k.a. "TVL").</li>
		<li>The XDAI sent for minting gets locked forever into liquidity.</li>
		<li>DON"T TRY TO "BUY DAIX" ‚Äï if you "buy" it, you will lose DAIX.</li></ul>
		<b>ALWAYS "MINT" DAIX. NEVER BUY DAIX.</b>
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>How to buy DAOX?</b></summary>
		DAOX is available at the leading DEXes of the blockchains. On xDAI Chain, DAOX can be swapped for DAIX at BaoSwap, HoneySwap, LevinSwap and Swapr.<br>
		It could be possible to buy DAOX from honeyswap with XDAI, as it would simply route you through DAIX. This would mean your XDAI first buys DAIX from honeyswap and then that DAIX buys DAOX.
		<br><b>This is NOT RECOMMENDED.</b><br>
		Always "buy" DAIX from our Daibase smart contract direclty. Buying DAOX directly from the DEX is not a problem in itself. However, we should avoid buying DAIX from a DEX. For example, buying DAOX with XDAI could have resulted in buying DAIX from the DEX first.<br>
You might ask, "Why someone should buy ('mint') DAIX from the contract instead of buying directly?"
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>Why someone should buy ('mint') DAIX from the contract instead of buying directly?</b></summary>
	There are a few reasons:
	<ol>
		<li>Buying DAIX from honeyswap (or any DEX) is very expensive.
		<ul>
			<li>This incurs 1% transaction tax.</li>
			<li>It incurs 0.3% trade fees.</li>
			<li>If your trade gets 'routed through DAIX', honeyswap would charge you 1.3% extra for each 'hop'.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Buying DAIX from the DEX incurs slippage.
		<ul>
			<li>if someone else is also trading in DAIX when you go to buy it on honeyswap, the amounts you receive might not be the ones expected by you. Other trades would influence the DAIX amounts you receive.</li>
			<li>Direct minting DAIX helps in growing the PCV (Protocol Controlled Value)</li>
			<li>This eases trading for future trades.</li>
			<li>Helps to reduce slippage in future.</li>
			<li>Makes for a bigger (de-)Central Bank Reserve (which is directly owned by all DAIX holders)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Buying from the Daibase contract (by sending XDAI directly to its address, with gas limit 500k) is way more cheaper and efficient.
		<ul>
			<li>Incurs zero (0%) slippage losses.</li>
			<li>Incurs zero (0%) trading fees.</li>
			<li>Incurs zero (0%) transaction tax.</li>
			<li>Fully predictable amounts of DAIX received.</li>
			<li>Allows you to reset price back to $1 (optional‚Äï it's your wish, just need to press the "BaseCannon" button).</li>
		</ul></li>
		</ol>
		So, if you want to buy DAOX, the best way is to:
		<br>1. Send your XDAI to Daibase contract address directly. (Use gas limit of 500000)
		<br>2. Use the DAIX received in step 1. above to buy DAOX from honeyswap.
		<br>This method will be a lot, lot cheaper and give you a lot, lot more DAOX than buying with Native Coins (XDAI) at a DEX.
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>Which blockchains are supported?</b></summary>
		As of now, Ropsten (testnet) and xDAI Chain (mainnet) version are supported.</details>
		<details><summary><b>How often can we press the<i>"BaseCannon"</i>button?</b></summary>
		On-Demand "bases" are a core tenet of Daibase Protocol. However, it's restricted to once in 50 blocks (about 4m10s on xDAI Chain, 12m30s on Ropsten) to prevent over-spamming.</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is the<i>"rebase lag"</i>?</b></summary>
		There is no lag. Lag is needed on blockchains like ETH where we need to prioritize gas savings.</details>
		<details><summary><b>Is there a<i>"transaction tax"</i>?</b></summary>
		A small fee of 1% is initially levied on each DAIX and DAOX transaction. The taxes collected are used by the KingMaker contract, if enabled, otherwise they're used to fund more farms or other ecosystem incentices, as dictated by the aixDAO by voting with their DAOX rights. The fees for DAIX are expected to be reduced as it's usage increases within smart-contracts.</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is the<i>"KingMaker"</i>?</b></summary>
		The KingMaker is a smart-contract that orchestrates an<i>on-chain open-auctioning</i> of transaction taxes generated by DAIX and DAOX. Anyone is allowed to bid with their native coins (XDAI) to contest for the right to drain all the treasures from this contract. The highest bidder is crowned as<i>"The Chosen One"</i> for 500000 blocks. Whenever someone makes a<i>"sacrifice"</i>8% greater than the previous<i>"Heir to DaiX"</i>, they ascend the throne as the new<i>Chosen One</i>. The reward is a huge, direct 1% from the whole of transaction volumes generated by DAIX and DAOX. After a "Heir" goes "unchallenged" through their "reign", the "sacrifice" resets to 0.001 Coins (XDAI).<br>
		To keep an eye on the timers or make a sacrifice, visit the "Heir to DaiX" section!</details>
		<details><summary><b>Where does the money bid into the KingMaker go?</b></summary>
		The bids are used to fund even more farms, vaults, staking services, partner programs and other things mandated by the DAO. The KingMaker relieves the sell pressure at a single point and distributes it to the Heirs of DaiX.</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is the use-case of Daibase?</b></summary>
		Daibase Protocol at large aspires to serve as an alternate (De-)Central Bank. It issues 1 DAIX only when it is paid 1 DAI in advance by the issuer, and locks it into it's Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). The currency it issues (DAIX) can be used akin to a real-life cash-asset: For trading, purchasing, borrowing, lending, mortgaging, leveraging and releveraging, and for a multitude of other things as highlighted in the<b>Supplement - I</b>section of our Goldpaper (permalink:https://daibase.github.io/goldpaper).</details>
		<details><summary><b>Are the DAIX collateralized?</b></summary>
		No. DAIX are entirely<b>uncollateralized</b>. There is no promise of 1:1 backing of DAIX with DAI. However, if and when the DaixDAO decides to<i>"Dissolve the Reserves",</i>the outstanding P.C.V. backs the entire issuancce of DAIX outside the<i>"Cardinal Pair".</i><br>This kind of an event, however rare, is possible. Hence it can ascertain an<i>"implicit collateralization"</i>to DAIX.</details>
		<br><br><br><br>
	</div>
	<h3 align="center">Known Bugs</h3>
	<b>"This seems to be a problem with one of the tokens you're swapping"</b>
	It has been found that this situation can be solved by the below methods:
	<ol>
		<li>Increasing Slippage Tolerance to 3% or more depending on the number of "hops", or intermediary tokens traversed during your swap.</li>
		<li>A slippage of 5% is enough to Add or Remove liquidity. Using 3% for simple ETH/DAIX pairs is ample.</li>
		<li>Editing input and/or output amounts manually.</li>
		<li>Removing excessive decimal parts and rounding the numbers.</li>
		<li>Swapping in the opposite direction with near zero amounts.</li>
		<li>Adding or removing liquidity.</li>
		<li>Try a hard refresh (Ctrl-F5, CMD-F5 or Alt-Shift-R) and using a nearer but different amount.<li>
<i>NOTE: This is a tricky error to overcome, and could depend on sheer luck. Almost all tokens with an elastic supply (or auto-burning features) experience this issue. Uniswap team hopes to resolve it in it's Uniswapv3 front-end wrapper. Advanced users can manually attempt a swap by directly interacting with a pair's smart contract. Otherwise atleast one or a combination of the above methods should cure this error.</i>
	</ol>
	<b>"Error: Undefined"</b>
	Such a error arises if there's a disbalance in the pairs balances and the count of its reserves in its memory. This is common in newly listed pairs and can be cured by:
	<ol>
		<li>Making a "multi-hop" swap.</li>
		<li>Executing a "flash" swap.</li>
		<li>Having the pair contract added to the Daibase "core" smart contract.<br>This can be done only by the DaixDAO voting if DAIX has already launched.<br>Such a pair must have adequate liquidity to be eligible/adopted by the DAO because adding a new pair results in increased costs for each new epoch.</li>
		<li>Hitting the BaseCannon can cure it sometimes.</li>
		<li>Synchronizing also can solve this issue, and would be cheaper than creating a new Epoch.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3 align="center">Exceptions</h3>
	<li>Don't send more than 10 Billion coins (ETH/XDAI/BNB/ONE,etc.) to the contract for a direct purchase or parti().</li>
	<li>Don't hit the BaseCannon twice within 60 blocks (about 12 min. on Eth, 5 mins. on xDAI and Polygon, 3 min. on BSC and Tron, 2 min. on Harmony, etc.).</li>
	<i>NOTE: This limit is reduced to 4 Blocks during the testing phase.</i>
	<li>"FAIL: OUT OF GAS"</li>
	This can occur when sending native coins (XDAI/ETH/BNB/ONE/MATIC/TRX,etc.) to the DAIX Smart Contract. It happens due to MetaMask or other Wallets erroneously ascribing a "Gas Limit" of "21000". We suggest manually editing it to "500000" (Five hundred thousands) instead.

		<i><b>What are DAIX tokens?</b><br>
		<br>DAIX is a cross-chain compatible array of tokens that target the multi-collateral DAI stablecoin.<br>
		<br>Native DAIX tokens are non-collateralized algorithmic stablecoins, issued on multiple chains:<div align="left" style="margin:10px">
		‚á® xDAI Chain (XDAI)<br>
		‚á® Binance Smart Chain (BNB)<br>
		‚á® Harmony (ONE)<br>
		‚á® Polygon (MATIC)<br>
		‚á® Avalanche (AVAX)<br>
		‚Ä¶ and more to come!</div>
		</i>
		</div>
		<div id="intro_pro">
		<i><b>Why do we need DAIX?</b><br>
		<br>Chances are, you have used ERC20-DAI and other similar assets on Ethereum. But now, along with the cryptocurrency prices, the transaction costs have also gone up, and aren't essentially too attractive as compared to the competetive blockchain solutions of today, like xDAI.</i><br><br>DAIX brings a brand new sub-asset class to the most efficient, day-to-day use blockchains.<br><br>It is the first multi-chain Decentral Bank with Protocol Controlled Value pivoted Elastic Currency in the world.<br><br>

		<div id="intro_sol">
		<i><b>Where to find DAIX tokens?</b><br>
		<br>DAIX protocol strives to be multi-chain compatible.<br>
		<br>Native DAIX stablecoins will be launched on multiple blockchains, including Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon (MATIC), Solana ($SOL) and Ethereum.<br>
		<br>First listing will be at Honeyswap of the xDAI blockchain network.<br>
		<br>You can also generate xDAIX (DAIX native to xDAI blockachain) by simply sending some xDAI coins to the DAIX smart contract.<br>Kindly use a "gas limit" of 500000 (500k).</i>
		<br><br><div id="intro_sol_dis">Discover DAIX Ecosytem!</div><!--The FEES Protocol is very simple to use: Just transform your TRC-20 Tokens into thier *F pegged-assets, and use these pegged-tokens for your daily use, without worrying about the energy costs burning your precious TRX away!-->
		</div>
		<div id="intro_pro">
		<i><b>How do these DAIX stabilize?</b><br>
		<br>When the price of any DAIX is above 1 DAI (roughly $1) in the open market, DAIX coins are sent across all addresses upto the amount which brings the price back to 1 DAI inthe open markets.<br>
		<br>Similarly, when the price falls under a DAI, the stabilization mechanism makes all users burn their DAIX tokens!<br>
		Apart from this, there is a tiny fees that goes to the promotional aspect of DAIX: Farms and Vaults, which help secure the DAIX against flash attacks by locking up (staking) *DAIX tokens. All DAIX users can participate in these promotional events and earn rewards!</i><br><br>Anyone can make 1 DAIX equal 1 DAI at the press of a big button below!<br>

	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<h4>ALWAYS "MINT" DAIX. NEVER "BUY" DAIX.</h4>
	If you "buy", you are certain to lose DAIX. Always use the "mint" function to acquire DAIX or get some from our shopping section.<hr style="padding:0;width:50%"><br><br>
	<div align="left">
		<details><summary><b>What is DAIX?</b></summary>
		DAIX is an elastic supply "rebasing" algorithmic stablecoin ‚Äïit adjusts to market conditions and maintains it's price at $1 by changing its circulating supply dynamically whenever someone presses the "BaseCannon" button on our Dapp.
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is DAOX?</b></summary>
		DAOX is the governance token of Daibase Protocol. Holders of DAOX get to decide the future of Daibase via creating and voting on "proposals". DAOX can always be earned through one of our farms, partner programs or other ecosytem incentives.
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>How to<i>"mint"</i>DAIX?</b></summary>
		There are 5 ways to mint DAIX tokens. Please use one of these methods:<ol>
		<li>Visit the shopping section and enter the amounts you wish to buy.</li>
		<li>Send some XDAI directly to the Daibase Contract address.</li>
		<li>Call the <code>parti()</code> function on the Daibase contract.</li>
		<li>Implement <code>interface IXD</code> in a smart contract to mint from within.</li>
		<li>Use the <code>override parti()</code> function to mint DAIX to a different address.</li>
		<li>Via the <code>interface IXD</code> from a smart contract, <code>override parti()</code> can delegate a mint to an E.O.A. or even another smart-contract.</li></ol>
		Please note that:<ul></li>
		<li>Use "Gas Limit" of 500000 (500k) when minting DAIX.</li>
		<li>"Minting" doesn't have any fees.</li>
		<li>"Minting" helps us increase the Protocol Controlled Value (PCV, a.k.a. "TVL").</li>
		<li>The XDAI sent for minting gets locked forever into liquidity.</li>
		<li>DON"T TRY TO "BUY DAIX" ‚Äï if you "buy" it, you will lose DAIX.</li></ul>
		<b>ALWAYS "MINT" DAIX. NEVER BUY DAIX.</b>
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>How to buy DAOX?</b></summary>
		DAOX is available at the leading DEXes of the blockchains. On xDAI Chain, DAOX can be swapped for DAIX at BaoSwap, HoneySwap, LevinSwap and Swapr.<br>
		It could be possible to buy DAOX from honeyswap with XDAI, as it would simply route you through DAIX. This would mean your XDAI first buys DAIX from honeyswap and then that DAIX buys DAOX.
		<br><b>This is NOT RECOMMENDED.</b><br>
		Always "buy" DAIX from our Daibase smart contract direclty. Buying DAOX directly from the DEX is not a problem in itself. However, we should avoid buying DAIX from a DEX. For example, buying DAOX with XDAI could have resulted in buying DAIX from the DEX first.<br>
You might ask, "Why someone should buy ('mint') DAIX from the contract instead of buying directly?"
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>Why someone should buy ('mint') DAIX from the contract instead of buying directly?</b></summary>
	There are a few reasons:
	<ol>
		<li>Buying DAIX from honeyswap (or any DEX) is very expensive.
		<ul>
			<li>This incurs 1% transaction tax.</li>
			<li>It incurs 0.3% trade fees.</li>
			<li>If your trade gets 'routed through DAIX', honeyswap would charge you 1.3% extra for each 'hop'.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Buying DAIX from the DEX incurs slippage.
		<ul>
			<li>if someone else is also trading in DAIX when you go to buy it on honeyswap, the amounts you receive might not be the ones expected by you. Other trades would influence the DAIX amounts you receive.</li>
			<li>Direct minting DAIX helps in growing the PCV (Protocol Controlled Value)</li>
			<li>This eases trading for future trades.</li>
			<li>Helps to reduce slippage in future.</li>
			<li>Makes for a bigger (de-)Central Bank Reserve (which is directly owned by all DAIX holders)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Buying from the Daibase contract (by sending XDAI directly to its address, with gas limit 500k) is way more cheaper and efficient.
		<ul>
			<li>Incurs zero (0%) slippage losses.</li>
			<li>Incurs zero (0%) trading fees.</li>
			<li>Incurs zero (0%) transaction tax.</li>
			<li>Fully predictable amounts of DAIX received.</li>
			<li>Allows you to reset price back to $1 (optional‚Äï it's your wish, just need to press the "BaseCannon" button).</li>
		</ul></li>
		</ol>
		So, if you want to buy DAOX, the best way is to:
		<br>1. Send your XDAI to Daibase contract address directly. (Use gas limit of 500000)
		<br>2. Use the DAIX received in step 1. above to buy DAOX from honeyswap.
		<br>This method will be a lot, lot cheaper and give you a lot, lot more DAOX than buying with Native Coins (XDAI) at a DEX.
		</details>
		<details><summary><b>Which blockchains are supported?</b></summary>
		As of now, Ropsten (testnet) and xDAI Chain (mainnet) version are supported.</details>
		<details><summary><b>How often can we press the<i>"BaseCannon"</i>button?</b></summary>
		On-Demand "bases" are a core tenet of Daibase Protocol. However, it's restricted to once in 50 blocks (about 4m10s on xDAI Chain, 12m30s on Ropsten) to prevent over-spamming.</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is the<i>"rebase lag"</i>?</b></summary>
		There is no lag. Lag is needed on blockchains like ETH where we need to prioritize gas savings.</details>
		<details><summary><b>Is there a<i>"transaction tax"</i>?</b></summary>
		A small fee of 1% is initially levied on each DAIX and DAOX transaction. The taxes collected are used by the KingMaker contract, if enabled, otherwise they're used to fund more farms or other ecosystem incentices, as dictated by the aixDAO by voting with their DAOX rights. The fees for DAIX are expected to be reduced as it's usage increases within smart-contracts.</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is the<i>"KingMaker"</i>?</b></summary>
		The KingMaker is a smart-contract that orchestrates an<i>on-chain open-auctioning</i> of transaction taxes generated by DAIX and DAOX. Anyone is allowed to bid with their native coins (XDAI) to contest for the right to drain all the treasures from this contract. The highest bidder is crowned as<i>"The Chosen One"</i> for 500000 blocks. Whenever someone makes a<i>"sacrifice"</i>8% greater than the previous<i>"Heir to DaiX"</i>, they ascend the throne as the new<i>Chosen One</i>. The reward is a huge, direct 1% from the whole of transaction volumes generated by DAIX and DAOX. After a "Heir" goes "unchallenged" through their "reign", the "sacrifice" resets to 0.001 Coins (XDAI).<br>
		To keep an eye on the timers or make a sacrifice, visit the "Heir to DaiX" section!</details>
		<details><summary><b>Where does the money bid into the KingMaker go?</b></summary>
		The bids are used to fund even more farms, vaults, staking services, partner programs and other things mandated by the DAO. The KingMaker relieves the sell pressure at a single point and distributes it to the Heirs of DaiX.</details>
		<details><summary><b>What is the use-case of Daibase?</b></summary>
		Daibase Protocol at large aspires to serve as an alternate (De-)Central Bank. It issues 1 DAIX only when it is paid 1 DAI in advance by the issuer, and locks it into it's Protocol Controlled Value (PCV). The currency it issues (DAIX) can be used akin to a real-life cash-asset: For trading, purchasing, borrowing, lending, mortgaging, leveraging and releveraging, and for a multitude of other things as highlighted in the<b>Supplement - I</b>section of our Goldpaper (permalink:https://daibase.github.io/goldpaper).</details>
		<details><summary><b>Are the DAIX collateralized?</b></summary>
		No. DAIX are entirely<b>uncollateralized</b>. There is no promise of 1:1 backing of DAIX with DAI. However, if and when the DaixDAO decides to<i>"Dissolve the Reserves",</i>the P.C.V. backs the entire issuancce of DAIX outside the<i>"Cardinal Pair".</i><br>This kind of an event however rare, is possible, and ascertains an<i>implicit collateralization"</i>to DAIX.</details>

<div style="overflow-x:auto">
<h2 align="center" >SNAPSHOT : 0001</h2>
During the ongoing development of<code>v0.1.76</code>, we identified a potential attack vector against Daibase Protocol.<br>
The exploit could trick the system and potentially be employed to mint an infinite amount of DAIX. If the attacker posesses an amount of DAI greater than twice the market cap of DAIX, they could launch a slow but potent "sandwhich" attack on future minters.
<h4>Current Status</h4>
Daibase v0.1.61(m) has been retired and shall be replaced with Daibase v0.1.80+ or later versions that combat any possibilities of such an attack vector.<br>
The supply of DAIX at this point was 4,517.458, worth $4,517.458.<br>
Protocol Reserve was 1,555.601, worth $1,555.601.<br>
Protocol Controlled Value was 694.161, worth $694.161.
<h4>Reproducing the Attack</h4>
Will be outlined in a separate article.
<!--The attacker would first themselves mint a sizeable amount of DAIX by paying XDAI (DAI) to the Daibase core smart contract.
<h4>Protective Operation by PCV-C</h4>
Burn HoneySwap LP<br>
DAIX/WXDAI (402.2 LP) with pool share of 99.999868% for DAIX:346.973 and WXDAI:347.229-->
<h4>VLF Recovery</h4>
Owing to the bug, we ourlselves replicated this operation and were able to mint more DAIX than one would expect by tricking the Orcale. More details will be outlined in the upcoming article.<br>
